# My Encrypted Journal

A Todo List web application that enables users to add and remove tasks.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python, Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, Docker

The graphical user interface was developed with a mix of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
Django was used to develop the backend of the application, storing data with a PostgreSQL image on Docker.
Currently supports add/delete requests.

## Optimizations

-> Added settings menu and interface that enables user to change their username and password

## Lessons Learned:

This project was pretty straightforward but served as a great introduction to a variety of significant topics.
In particular, I got my first experience with Django as a Python backened language along with PostgreSQL.

## Instructions

- **manage.py**: Use this file as the main module for your program.

-> Enter "python manage.py runserver"
